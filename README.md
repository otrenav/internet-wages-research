# Internet wages

- Omar Trejo
- March, 2016

This repository contains R code used in research regarding internet and wages
done by Omar Trejo and David RamÃ­rez. The main idea is that investment in
advanced internet technology increases the inequality gap between social
classes. The research being analyzed is based on

> [Forman, Goldfarb, and Greenstein - The internet and local wages (2012)](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/directory/faculty/forman/pubs/internet_and_local_wages.pdf)

We replicated the research for Mexico, and found a similar result. However,
instrumental variables are still needed to provide some causality arguments
which are currently missing.
